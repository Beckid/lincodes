# lincodes
This project wants to create an application to count the number of lines in a repository of text files

As a programmer, one can create a lot of text files to save their codes.
When we are talking about the computer screen of a programmer, most of us also has the first impression of many lines of codes.
That's the true daily lives of most programmers.
But as a programmer, won't it be motivating and inspring to view instantly how many lines you have wrote today?

=========================================
Therefore, I am happy to announce the launch of this application, Lincodes.
Its name is a combination of the word "lines" and the word "codes".
It is a cross-platform independent software / sidebar / add-on, whichever form you would like to use and whichever platform you are familiar with.

Feel happy to download and use it!
Frequently check our GitHub Homepage for the latest update and other information.

Sincerely,
